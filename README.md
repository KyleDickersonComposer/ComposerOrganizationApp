Composer Organization App
---
This is an app that will automatically set up a project structure that will suit media composition.
Maybe this could help with organization by automatically updating some spreadsheets and pushing changes to a git repo or maybe do some backup things like a background service.
Your wav files should be in the bWAV format which embeds timecode data in the metadata. The file name should be formatted thus: TCL_3m07_v2_10163203 (Three letter project id, cue number, version number, SMPTE dd:hh:mm:ss:ff). 
If you are delivering stems add _StemName.

Or, Something like:
- ABC/S1_E10_1m01

A glorious image from this git repo!

This is a sample spreadsheet for a tv show gig showing:
- cue number
- cue name
- timecode start
- timecode end
- timecode duration
- demo uploaded
- Feedback notes?
- Revision Uploaded
- Executive Approved?
- Sent to Orchestrator?
- LA Guitar (musician)
- Air1 Drums (musician)
- PC Percussion (musician)
- Bass (musician)
- Air 1 String (recording session)
- Stemmed?
- In Tools?
- Mixed? 
- Mix Good? 
- Delivered? 
- Tempo
- TC running total

When giving cue numbers the right side of the m should continue iterating and the left side should reflect the reel number.

Going to look at what those books have to say about project management. (LOL, nothing...)

Here is a mock folder structure that Gippity generated.

Gonna apply Primagens concept of the 6 month system rework. You are banned from tweaking your template until June 2024!
